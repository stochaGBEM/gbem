The goal of **gbem** is to implement a gravel bed river bank erosion model, calculating erosion volumes expected at a river's cross section given an event hydrograph.

**WARNING**: This package is under active development and is not intended to be used yet.

## Installation

As gbem is not on CRAN, you can install it from GitHub by running the following command in R:

``` r
remotes::install_github("stochaGBEM/gbem")
```

If this doesn't work, you may have to install the remotes package with the command `install.packages("remotes")`.

## Example

```{r example}
library(gbem)
library(sxchan)
library(sf)
```

### Cross Sections

Make channel cross sections from the default bankline polygon in the **sxchan** package, and add cross section features required for the Manning erosion engine. 

```{r}
channel <- xt_generate_sxc(demo_bankline, n = 100) |> 
  sx_manning(
    grad = 0.02, d50 = 65, d84 = 100, 
    roughness = seq(0.001, 0.01, length.out = 100)
  )
```

Here is what they look like.

```{r}
plot(demo_bankline)
plot(st_geometry(channel), add = TRUE)
```


What's the largest flow that the channel can accommodate without eroding? Visualize in a plot. 

```{r}
eroding_flow(channel, resistance = "manning") |> 
  plot(ylab = "Flow", xlab = "Cross Section Number")
```

Or, the reverse can be calculated: what's the minimum channel width that can accommodate a flow without eroding? Try a flow of 200:

```{r}
min_channel <- min_stable_channel(channel, flow = 200, resistance = "manning")
plot(demo_bankline)
plot(st_geometry(min_channel), add = TRUE)
```


### Hydrographs

Make a hydrograph from scratch:

```{r}
hg <- hydrograph(
  2 ~ 0, 3 ~ 1, 5 ~ 2, 3 ~ 5, 2 ~ 10
)
plot(hg)
```

Or, from a data frame; this time, also specify a time multiplier:

```{r}
data.frame(times = c(0, 1 / 3, 1), flow = c(100, 500, 200)) |> 
  as_hydrograph(times_from = times, flows_from = flow, unit = 24) |> 
  plot()
```

There are canned hydrographs for snowmelt-related and rainfall-related events, too:

```{r}
hyd_rain(peak = 200, baseflow = 50) |> 
  plot()
hyd_snow(peak = 200, baseflow = 50) |> 
  plot()
```

You can easily discretize the hydrograph if you'd like to do manual calculations:

```{r}
discretize_hydrograph(hg, niter = 10)
```

### Gravel-bed river bank erosion model

Let a hydrograph erode a channel using `gbem()`. That returns a gbem object encoding information about channel changes. Run `erode()` to execute the changes to get a new cross section:

```{r}
q <- eroding_flow(channel, resistance = "manning")
h <- hyd_rain(median(q) * 4, min(q) / 4)
g <- gbem(h, channel, niter = 1000, resistance = "manning")
```

Calculate the newly eroded channel, and visualize its cross sections:

```{r}
new_channel <- erode(g)
plot(demo_bankline)
plot(st_geometry(new_channel), add = TRUE)
```
