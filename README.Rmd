The goal of **gbem** is to implement a gravel bed river bank erosion model, calculating erosion volumes expected at a river's cross section given an event hydrograph.

**WARNING**: This package is under active development and is not intended to be used yet.

## Installation

As gbem is not on CRAN, you can install it from GitHub by running the following command in R:

``` r
remotes::install_github("stochaGBEM/gbem")
```

If this doesn't work, you may have to install the remotes package with the command `install.packages("remotes")`.

## Example

```{r example}
library(gbem)
```

### Hydrographs

Make a hydrograph from scratch:

```{r}
hg <- hydrograph(
  2 ~ 0, 3 ~ 1, 5 ~ 2, 3 ~ 5, 2 ~ 10
)
plot(hg)
```

Or, from a data frame; this time, also specify a time multiplier:

```{r}
data.frame(times = c(0, 1 / 3, 1), flow = c(100, 500, 200)) |> 
  as_hydrograph(times_from = times, flows_from = flow, unit = 24) |> 
  plot()
```

There are canned hydrographs for snowmelt-related and rainfall-related events, too:

```{r}
hyd_rain(peak = 200, baseflow = 50) |> 
  plot()
hyd_snow(peak = 200, baseflow = 50) |> 
  plot()
```

You can easily discretize the hydrograph if you'd like to do manual calculations:

```{r}
discretize_hydrograph(hg, 10)
```

### Cross Sections

Make a channel cross section:

```{r}
cs <- cross_section(width = 3, grad = 0.01, d50 = 0.1, d84 = 0.5, roughness = 0.01)
cs
```

### Gravel-bed river bank erosion model

Let a hydrograph erode a channel using `gbem()`. That returns a gbem object encoding information about channel changes. Run `erode()` to execute the changes to get a new cross section:

```{r}
g <- gbem2(hg, cross_section = cs, niter = 100)
erode(g)
```
