The goal of gbem is to calculate erosion volumes expected at a river’s
cross section, given flow magnitude and duration.

## Installation

As gbem is not on CRAN, you can install it from GitHub by running the
following command in R:

``` r
remotes::install_github("stochaGBEM/gbem")
```

If this doesn’t work, you may have to install the remotes package with
the command `install.packages("remotes")`.

## Example

``` r
library(gbem)
```
