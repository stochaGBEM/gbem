Description: gbem contains bank erosion algorithms applicable to gravel bed
    rivers. It allows for the creation of event hydrographs that are passed 
    through a series of channel cross sections, for which erosion amounts
    are calculated. A new eroded channel can thus be obtained, in the form
    of updated cross sections.
