\title{Minimum-Width Stable Channel}
\usage{
min_stable_channel(sx, flow, resistance = c("ferguson", "manning"))
}
\arguments{
\item{sx}{Channel cross sections containing features needed by the
erosion engine, such as created by the \code{sx()} functions such as
\code{sx_ferguson()} or \code{sx_manning()}.}

\item{flow}{Discharge carried by the stream; single numeric.}

\item{resistance}{Paradigm for modelling channel resistance; one of
\code{"ferguson"} for using Ferguson's equation, or \code{"manning"} for Manning's
equation.}
}
\value{
The original \code{sx} channel object, with cross section widths
modified to match the minimum width required to accommodate the flow
without eroding.
}
\description{
Calculates the channel with the smallest width that remains stable
under a given flow.
}
\examples{
library(sxchan)
x <- sx_manning(
  xt_sxc(c(1, 1, 1)), grad = 0.01, d50 = 45, d84 = 80,
  roughness = c(0.01, 0.02, 0.03)
)
y <- min_stable_channel(x, flow = 5, resistance = "manning")

xt_width(x)
xt_width(y)
